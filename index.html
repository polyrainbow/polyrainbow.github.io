He seems somehow fascinated by the flower, although he would later wonder what that was about. Sebastian looks like an okay person, but it's hard to tell from a photo, isn't it?"

  <p>
    I am a human interested in the web, audio, music making, and knowledge management, among other things.
    I work as a software developer.
    <br>
    One thing I am currently working on is <a href="https://polyrainbow.github.io/neno" target="_blank">NENO</a>,
    an application that helps you create your personal knowledge graph.
